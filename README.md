# TSX
- [tsx readme](https://github.com/esbuild-kit/tsx#readme)
- tsx is designed to be a drop-in replacement for node, so you can use it just the way you would use Node.js. All command-line arguments (with the exception of a few) are propagated to Node.js.

# TSM
- As a node CLI replacement
- As a CommonJS --require hook
- As an ESM --loader
